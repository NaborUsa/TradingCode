# 2 Wait for a pullback
# We wnat the priceActionIndicator to go below the EMA 21 green line
# usually then EMA3 red lime goes below the blue line
# and we wait for the red line EMS3 to cross above the blue linearRegAdjEMA EMS5 

# When then red linearRegAdjEMA EMA3 is close above the blue line
# this is the buy signal (candle green) and RSi shoud below above the center line
# but not above 70
# note: The lines should be separated inertia order with an upside angle.
#       If theyare jammed and the linea are on each other, we don't take the signal
#       sideway range

# close method_1: EMS3 crosses below EMS 5
